  <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.7149&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Q-learning</a>
  is one of the oldest and general reinforcement learning (RL)
  algorithms.  It works by estimating the long term future expected
  return for each state-action pair.  Essentially, the goal of the Q-learning
  algorithm is fold the long term outcome of each state-action pair
  into a single scalar that tells us how good the state-action pair
  combination is; then, we could maximize our reward by picking the
  action with the greatest value of the Q-function.  The Q-learning
  algorithm has been the basis of
  the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html">DQN</a>
  algorithm that demonstrated that the combination of RL
  and deep learning is a fruitful one.

<p>Your goal is to create a robust Q-learning implementation that can solve
  all <a href="https://lab.synthai.com">Lab</a> environments with
  continuous action spaces without changing hyperparameters. </p>

<p> You may want to use
  the <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00748.pdf">Normalized Advantage
  Function (NAF)</a> model as a starting point.  It is especially
  interesting to experiment with variants of the NAF model: for
  example, try it with a diagonal covariance. It can be also interesting to explore
  an advantage function that uses the maximum of several quadratics,
  which is a convenient function because their argmax is easy to
  compute.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
  This project is mainly concerned with reimplementing an existing
  algorithm. However, there is significant value in obtaining a very
  robust implementation, and there is a decent chance that new ideas
  will end up being required to get it working reliably, across
  multiple tasks.
