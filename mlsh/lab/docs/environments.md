# Environments

The lab comes prepackaged with many many environments. It's this common API around many environments that makes the lab so great. Here we will list additional environments that do not come prepacked with the lab. Submit another to this list via a pull-request. 

_**NOTICE**: Its possible that in time SynthAI will develop a full fledged repository of supplemental environments. Until then this bit of markdown will suffice._

## PGE: Parallel Game Engine

PGE is a FOSS 3D engine for AI simulations, and can interoperate with the Lab. Contains environments with modern 3D graphics, and uses Bullet for physics.

## lab-inventory: Inventory Control Environments

lab-inventory is a single agent domain featuring discrete state and action spaces that an AI agent might encounter in inventory control problems.

## lab-gazebo: training Robots in Gazebo

lab-gazebo presents an extension of the initial SynthAI lab for robotics using ROS and Gazebo, an advanced 3D modeling and
rendering  tool.
